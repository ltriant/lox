# Lox

Yet another Lox interpreter, because [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) is an awesome book.

## Extras to do

Some of the challenges at the end of chapters include adding language features that I'm keen on. Here's a list of the ones I sill have to come back to.

1. [Anonymous functions](https://craftinginterpreters.com/functions.html#challenges)
2. Deprecate `oUndefined`. Instead of `varExpression` being of type `Expr`, it should have the type `Option[Expr]`
